------------------------------------
**Day by Day Plan**

**Week 1: Foundation and Planning**

Day 1: Project initiation, define project scope for HandyConnect (connecting users with service providers), set up the development environment, and create a project repository.
Day 2: Detailed requirements gathering for user and provider profiles, service listings, search functionality, and booking/communication features. Consider specific user needs (homeowners, renters) and provider types (plumbers, electricians, cleaners, etc.).
Day 3: Design the database schema for user profiles, provider profiles, service categories, service listings, bookings, ratings, reviews, and communication logs.
Day 4: Plan the algorithms for location-based service discovery, matching users with relevant providers, and potentially ranking providers based on ratings and availability. Research available mapping APIs or libraries.
Day 5: Design the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for both users seeking services and service providers managing their profiles and bookings. Create wireframes or mockups.
Day 6: Set up the backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Python/Django) and begin initial setup for handling user and provider authentication and basic API endpoints for profiles and service listings.
Day 7: Initial setup of the frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) and create basic components for navigation and layout for both user and provider interfaces.


**Week 2: User & Provider Profile and Service Listing Development**

Day 8: Begin development of the location-based service discovery logic. Implement core logic for finding providers within a specified radius.
Day 9: Develop the data models for user profiles (including location, service needs) and provider profiles (including skills, experience, availability, service areas). Populate the database with sample data.
Day 10: Implement API endpoints for user and provider profile creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. Implement API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting service listings by providers.
Day 11: Integrate the profile and service listing backend with the frontend. Develop the UI for users to create their profiles and search for services. Develop the UI for providers to create and manage their profiles and service listings.
Day 12: Implement user and provider authentication and authorization for their respective sections.
Day 13: Add functionality for users to save favorite providers or services and for providers to manage their service areas and availability.
Day 14: Implement search and filter functionality for service listings based on category, location, availability, and keywords.

**Week 3: Booking and Communication Development**

Day 15: Develop the data models for booking requests, booking confirmations, and communication logs.
Day 16: Set up the booking backend, including API endpoints for submitting booking requests, managing booking status, and handling confirmations/rejections. Implement basic communication API endpoints.
Day 17: Develop the service listing detail page on the frontend, allowing users to view detailed information about providers and their services and initiate booking requests.
Day 18: Implement the booking request submission functionality, allowing users to specify dates, times, and details. Implement provider interface for viewing and managing booking requests.
Day 19: Develop the communication features (e.g., basic messaging between users and providers) using appropriate technologies (e.g., WebSockets or polling).
Day 20: Implement authorization rules for booking and communication features, ensuring users can only interact with relevant bookings and conversations.
Day 21: Develop booking history and management features for both users and providers.

**Week 4: Rating, Review, and Refinement**

Day 22: Develop the data models for ratings and reviews for service providers.
Day 23: Implement API endpoints for users to submit ratings and reviews for completed services and for providers to view their ratings and reviews.
Day 24: Integrate the rating and review system into the frontend, displaying provider ratings and allowing users to submit feedback. Potentially implement sorting/ranking of providers based on ratings.
Day 25: Conduct thorough testing of the entire application, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing for both user and provider workflows.
Day 26: Identify and fix any bugs or issues. Optimize the application for performance and scalability, especially the search and location-based features.
Day 27: Deploy the application to a staging environment for final testing and review by potential users (if possible).
Day 28: Prepare documentation for the application, including user manuals for both users and providers, and developer documentation.

**Week 5: Finalization and Deployment**

Day 29: Address feedback from testing on the staging environment.
Day 30: Finalize the project features and codebase.
Day 31: Deploy the HandyConnect application to a production environment.
